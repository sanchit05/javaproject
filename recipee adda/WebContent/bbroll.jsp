They're super fun eat and, of course, totally kid-friendly! It’s the perfect breakfast to make and enjoy with the entire family—there are many different fillings to try out and they can be rolled up ahead of time and cooked right before you're ready to serve.

<h1 align="center">Steps to Make It</h1>
<br>
<br>


<h4 align="left">
1    Gather the ingredients.
<br>
 <br>
2   Cut the crusts off of the slices of white bread. Using a rolling pin, flatten each slice of bread until they're completely flat.
 <br>
<br>
3    Whisk together the softened cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract.
<br>
 <br>
4   Spread some of the cream cheese mixture onto each of the slices of the white bread. Place four blueberries across the short end of the bread. 
<br>
 <br>
5   Roll the slice of bread over the blueberries and continue until it's completely rolled and then seal the end by pressing the edge lightly against the cylinder. 
<br>
 <br>
6   Whisk together the eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and whole milk in a medium-sized bowl until completely combined.
<br>
 <br>
7   Dip each one of the rollups into the egg wash. Dip twice to allow for extra absorption.
<br>
 <br>
8   Heat a griddle on medium-high heat. Add butter to the griddle.
<br>
 <br>
9   Place the roll-ups on the griddle and cook until golden brown. Rotate the roll-ups until every side has been cooked and is golden brown.
<br>
 <br>
10   Top additional blueberries, powdered sugar, and maple syrup.
<br>
 <br>
11  Serve and enjoy!

<h1 align="center">Variations</h1>
<h4>
    Ham and Cheese: Fill each roll-up with a slice of ham and gruyere or Swiss cheese. Serve them with some raspberry jam to make these Monte Cristo-style.
    Breakfast Sausage: Add one cooked sausage link to each slice of bread. Roll them up and make sure to serve them with extra maple syrup.
    Strawberry-Nutella: Spread a generous amount of Nutella onto each slice of bread and sprinkle with finely-chopped strawberries.
    Cinnamon Roll: Melt 3 tablespoons of butter and mix with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 3 cup of brown sugar to create a spreadable cinnamon-sugar filling. Spread a generous amount of the filling onto each slice of bread. Drizzle with a little homemade icing to finish them off (and make them look like the real thing!)
    Peanut Butter and Banana: Spread some peanut butter onto each slice of bread. Add four slices of banana and a sprinkle of cinnamon before rolling them all up.
